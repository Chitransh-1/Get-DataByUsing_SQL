A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) which provide an interface for users and applications to interact with the data. The primary purpose of a database is to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently and securely.

Key characteristics of databases include:

Structured Data: Data is organized in tables, rows, and columns, which allows for efficient querying and analysis.
Data Integrity: Databases enforce rules and constraints to maintain the accuracy and consistency of data.
Scalability: Modern databases can handle large volumes of data and can scale horizontally and vertically to accommodate growth.
Security: Databases provide mechanisms to control access, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific operations.
Backup and Recovery: Databases offer features to back up data and recover it in case of hardware failure, data corruption, or other disasters.
Concurrency: Multiple users and applications can access and manipulate data concurrently without compromising the integrity of the data.
Common types of databases include relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), and in-memory databases (e.g., Redis). Each type is optimized for different use cases and data structures.
